            <h1>My Trip to New Orleans, LA</h1>
            <img src="C:\Users\sr115\lc101\html-me-something\images\NOLA.jpg">
            <p>With my girlfriend having a work conference in NOLA the week before MLK weekend,<br> we decided to stay the weekend and make a vacation out of it.<br></p>
            <p>The trip was <strong>incredible</strong>, but with so much to see and do in a short amount of time,<br> we focused on a few points of interest.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#bourbon">Bourbon Street</a></li>
                <li><a href="#jackson">Jackson Street</a></li>
                <li><a href="#jean">Jean Lafitte National Historical Park</a></li>
            </ul>

                <h1>Bourbon Street</h1>
                <p>The French Quarter is the oldest neighborhood in NOLA and its main attraction is Bourbon Street.  For a 13-block stretch, there were mostly bars, clubs, and other such places that cater to the night life.  The stereotypical debauchery was on full display with many people parading the streets with little left to the imagination.  At around midnight, a full marching band with bead tossing floats in tow, strode down the street, only adding to the already abundant musical milieu.</p>

                <h1>Jackson Square</h1>
                <p>Another great attraction we visited in the French Quarter was Jackson Square.  The park is a veritable bazar featuring artists of all types.  Sculptures and paintings displaying masterful creativity were abundant, with some ranging in the thousands of dollars.  In addition, street musicians and performers plied their trade in every nook and cranny, creating an incredible tableau.</p>

                <h1>Jean Lafitte National Historical Park</h1>
                <p>This National Park serves as a preserve for local wildlife and as a testament to the role the environment has played in the rise of NOLA.  We specifically visited the Barataria Preserve, which featured several miles of trails through the area.  We picked a 5 mile trail along the Kenta Canal, which afforded us the opportunity to achieve our admitted main goal in visiting the parkâ€”to see wild alligators!  Mission Accomplished!! </p>
